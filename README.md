# Elevator

Some assumptions I made were that this elevator serviced 11 levels total (ranging from 0-10), that the elevator would always start on the 0th floor, and that no additional passengers would board during the elevator ride. Some additional features that could be added would be those that would allow for elevator rides that did not necessarily fit these assumptions, like having the user input the number of floors of their building, having the elevator start at a random floor, and having additional passengers come on board during your ride.
