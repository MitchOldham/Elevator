# Elevator

Some assumptions I made were that this elevator serviced 11 levels total (ranging from 0-10), that the elevator would always start on the 0th floor, and that no additional passengers would board during the elevator ride. Some additional features that could be added would be to allow for elevator rides that did not fit these assumptions, like having the user input the size of their building, having the elevator start at random floors, or having additional passengers come on board during your ride.
